Final game for ENGR 103

### Inputs

Switch – on/off (true/false)

Buttons – right or left, or null

### outputs

Sound; LED flashes (depending on events)

Switch – turns the game on or off, can also act as a reset.

Buttons – act as user input to time the red LED path to the chosen LED.

### Basic Instructions

Once the game is turned on, the CPX will flash GREEN and play an opening tune.

For each level, one LED will be highlighted YELLOW, and after a second, the rest of the LEDs will turn RED.
The player will have to wait until the red LED path reaches the YELLOW LED and push any button once the YELLOW LED turns RED.

If the player is successful, a correct tune will play and the game will move on to the next level.
If the player is unsuccessful, an incorrect tune will play, and the lights will flash RED. The level will start over to level 1.

There are 3 levels, each one raising in difficulty (the red LED path will be faster, and the player will have less time to correctly time their button)

If the player doesn't hit any buttons, the incorrect sequence will play.

To turn off, turn the switch to FALSE and either wait for the game sequence to end or push a button to get the level wrong.
The end Sequence will flash RED.
